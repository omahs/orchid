This is a minimal  JS entry point that exports the WalletConnectEthereumProvider from @walletconnect/ethereum-provider into the window so that Flutter can interact with it.

The alternative might be to use a published UMD package like the one we used previously for Wallet Connect v1.  However I was unable to find one.
